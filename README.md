Check your level of burnout risk with this predictor.
🔥 Burnout Risk Predictor (Future of Workplace Well-being)

“A healthy team is a high-performing team.”
This project helps organizations predict employee burnout risk before it happens — using data, machine learning, and a human touch.

 What This Project Does

This isn’t just another ML demo.
It’s a well-being assistant for the future of work:

* Predicts burnout risk (Low / Moderate / High) from daily work-life patterns
* Visualizes probabilities so managers don’t just see labels, they see confidence levels
* Provides an interactive web app (built with Streamlit) where HR or leaders can play with inputs (sleep hours, meetings, breaks, etc.) to see outcomes in real-time

 Why It Matters in 2025 and Beyond

 Burnout costs the global economy ~$1 trillion annually in lost productivity.
Traditional surveys catch it too late. This predictor gives early signals — helping companies build healthier, happier teams.

Imagine being a CEO or HR:

Want to know how “too many meetings” impacts team well-being? → Test it.

Curious if adding breaks reduces burnout? → Simulate it.

See data + empathy merge to shape the future workplace.

 Tech Stack

Python  (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy)

Logistic Regression → interpretable + lightweight

Streamlit → turns ML model into an interactive app

Matplotlib → beautiful visual insights

 Features Demo

Input daily lifestyle & work factors → get burnout prediction

Real-time probability bars for Low / Moderate / High risk

Interactive scenario testing (e.g., “What if employees sleep 8 hrs vs 4 hrs?”)

 Vision for the Future

This is just Step 1. Future versions may include:

Real-time integration with workplace tools (Calendars, Slack, HRMS)

Personalized wellness recommendations (not just predictions)

Dashboard for managers to track trends without invading privacy
